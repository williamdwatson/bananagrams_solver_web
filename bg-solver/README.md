# Rust/WebAssembly solver
The core of the Bananagrams solver is written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly using [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack). This is a modified version of my implementation [here](https://github.com/williamdwatson/bananagrams_solver). Changes include state management being moved to JavaScript and a lack of threading. See the [main Rust repo](https://github.com/williamdwatson/bananagrams_solver) for more information.
